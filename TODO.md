# TODOs

- Create more presets (aurora, other fire, scanner, music 
  (both volume vise and frequency vise effects), fade, ocean (like fire, but ocean))
- Normalize preset settings (i.e. normal speed setting is always 128, the same for scale)
- Decrease CPU load on microcontroller
- Write nix package for desktop app (almost completed, need to add .desktop file)
