# TODOs

- Create more presets (aurora, other fire, scanner, music
  (both volume vise and frequency vise effects), fade, ocean (like fire, but ocean))
- Implement setting wifi settings via captive portal (AP and STA switching), update wifi logic
- Write android app
- Optimize code to have less future switching to prevent heating and prolong lifespan of the controller
